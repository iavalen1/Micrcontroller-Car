# Micrcontroller-Car

This is a car that I worked on for my embedded systems class. We used a Freedom Board microcontroller and various car parts and sesnors to make a little car that uses PWM to calculate distance and roatations and PID for speed control. The entire project was coded in C using the MCUExpresso IDE.
